# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating a comprehensive School Information Management System (SIM) from PHP Laravel with Filament admin panel to a Spring Boot Maven backend with REST API architecture. The current system manages students, teachers, attendance, assessments, extracurricular activities, and various school administrative functions. The migration aims to modernize the backend architecture while maintaining all existing functionality and improving performance, scalability, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Management and Authentication

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage users (teachers, students, administrators) with role-based access control, so that different user types can access appropriate system features securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to authenticate THEN the system SHALL validate credentials using Spring Security with JWT tokens
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate roles (ADMIN, TEACHER, STUDENT) with corresponding permissions
3. WHEN a user profile is created or updated THEN the system SHALL validate required fields (name, email, NIP for teachers, NIS for students)
4. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL generate secure reset tokens with expiration
5. IF a user has multiple roles THEN the system SHALL handle role hierarchy and permission inheritance

### Requirement 2: Student Management System

**User Story:** As a school administrator, I want to manage comprehensive student records including personal information, class assignments, and academic status, so that I can maintain accurate student data and track their academic progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student record is created THEN the system SHALL validate and store personal information (NIS, full name, birth details, contact information, address)
2. WHEN a student is assigned to a class THEN the system SHALL update class enrollment and validate capacity constraints
3. WHEN student status changes (active, inactive, graduated, transferred) THEN the system SHALL update records and trigger appropriate notifications
4. WHEN student data is imported via Excel THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and provide error reporting
5. IF duplicate NIS is detected THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and return appropriate error message

### Requirement 3: Attendance Management System

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to record and track student attendance for classes, extracurricular activities, and prayer sessions, so that I can monitor student participation and generate attendance reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attendance is recorded THEN the system SHALL accept status values (present, late, absent, sick, permit) with optional notes
2. WHEN attendance data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate teaching activity exists and user has permission
3. WHEN attendance reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports by date range, class, or student
4. WHEN bulk attendance is recorded THEN the system SHALL process multiple entries efficiently with transaction integrity
5. IF attendance conflicts with existing records THEN the system SHALL handle updates appropriately

### Requirement 4: Academic Assessment System

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to create and manage student assessments including grades, evaluations, and academic progress tracking, so that I can monitor and report on student academic performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an assessment is created THEN the system SHALL define assessment criteria, scoring rubrics, and evaluation methods
2. WHEN student grades are entered THEN the system SHALL validate score ranges and calculation methods
3. WHEN assessment reports are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate averages, rankings, and progress indicators
4. WHEN assessment data is exported THEN the system SHALL provide Excel format with customizable templates
5. IF assessment modifications are made THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail of changes

### Requirement 5: Class and Schedule Management

**User Story:** As a school administrator, I want to manage class schedules, teaching activities, and classroom assignments, so that I can organize academic activities efficiently and avoid scheduling conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teaching schedule is created THEN the system SHALL validate time slots, teacher availability, and classroom capacity
2. WHEN schedule conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent double-booking and suggest alternatives
3. WHEN teaching activities are recorded THEN the system SHALL link to subjects, teachers, classes, and time periods
4. WHEN schedule changes are made THEN the system SHALL notify affected teachers and students
5. IF bulk schedule import is performed THEN the system SHALL validate data consistency and report errors

### Requirement 6: Extracurricular Activity Management

**User Story:** As an extracurricular supervisor, I want to manage extracurricular activities, member enrollment, and activity attendance, so that I can track student participation in non-academic programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an extracurricular activity is created THEN the system SHALL define activity details, supervisors, and member capacity
2. WHEN students enroll in activities THEN the system SHALL validate eligibility and capacity constraints
3. WHEN activity attendance is recorded THEN the system SHALL track participation and generate activity reports
4. WHEN activity schedules are managed THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicts with academic schedules
5. IF activity status changes THEN the system SHALL update member records and notify participants

### Requirement 7: Reporting and Data Export

**User Story:** As a school administrator, I want to generate comprehensive reports and export data in various formats, so that I can analyze school performance and meet reporting requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate data in Excel, PDF, and CSV formats
2. WHEN custom report parameters are specified THEN the system SHALL filter data by date ranges, classes, subjects, or students
3. WHEN bulk data export is performed THEN the system SHALL handle large datasets efficiently with progress indicators
4. WHEN report templates are used THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent formatting and branding
5. IF report generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Data Migration and Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate existing data from the Laravel system to Spring Boot, so that historical data is preserved and the transition is seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data migration is initiated THEN the system SHALL extract data from Laravel MySQL database with data integrity validation
2. WHEN data transformation is performed THEN the system SHALL map Laravel models to Spring Boot entities accurately
3. WHEN migration validation is conducted THEN the system SHALL verify data completeness and referential integrity
4. WHEN rollback is required THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to restore previous state
5. IF migration errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue with valid records

### Requirement 9: API Design and Documentation

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want well-documented REST APIs with consistent response formats, so that I can integrate the frontend application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL return consistent JSON response formats with proper HTTP status codes
2. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation with examples
3. WHEN API versioning is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and clear deprecation policies
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses with helpful messages
5. IF API rate limiting is required THEN the system SHALL implement throttling with appropriate headers

### Requirement 10: Security and Performance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to be secure, performant, and scalable, so that it can handle school operations reliably and protect sensitive data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive data is processed THEN the system SHALL encrypt data at rest and in transit using industry standards
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL optimize performance with proper indexing and caching
3. WHEN concurrent users access the system THEN the system SHALL handle load efficiently with connection pooling
